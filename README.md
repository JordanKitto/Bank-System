This project is a simple bank account simulation program written in Python. It allows users to create an account with a unique 4-digit account number and PIN, login, and perform basic banking operations. The key features include:

    Account Creation: Users can set up a new account by providing a 4-digit account number and PIN.
    Login System: Secure login with account number and PIN verification.
    Banking Functions:
        View account balance.
        Deposit money with preset or custom amounts.
        Withdraw money with preset or custom amounts (with balance checks).
        Future capability to transfer money between accounts (placeholder function included).
    User Status: Check account login status.
    Logout and Restart: Users can log out or restart the program at any time.

While the program is straightforward, it has been an excellent starting point for me to learn about user input handling, data structures, and conditional logic in Python. I'd love to hear your feedback, suggestions for improvement, and any bugs you might find! ðŸ˜Š
